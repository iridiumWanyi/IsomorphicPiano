## Isomorphic Piano Simulator
A web-based isomorphic keyboard simulator that allows users to play notes, chords, and arpeggios with customizable layouts and user-defined chords. 

## Features
- Isomorphic(Janko) Keyboard Layout
- Chord Modes: Play predefined chords (e.g., Major, Minor, Dominant 7, Major 9) with a single key press.
- Custom Chords: Define up to four custom chords with user-specified intervals (e.g., "0,4,7" is the major chord).
- Arpeggiator: Toggle an arpeggiator with adjustable BPM and pattern.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- A local server (e.g., VS Code’s Live Server) to avoid CORS issues with audio file loading.
